    - first name
    - last name
    - id number
    - salary
    - job, which is one of the {:none, :coder, :designer, :manager, :ceo }
- id number has a default value that is previous id + 1
- salary has a default value 0
- job has a default value of :none
- Implement functions *Employee.promote* and *Employee.demote* which updates the job accordingly.
    - job :none salary is set to 0
    - each job above :none gets 2000 more salary than previous

- Test your *Employee* module and its *promote* and *demote* functions.
