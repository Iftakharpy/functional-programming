## **Home Assignment 3**
Copy the source code to Moodle return box. Alternatively you can paste a link to GitLab. If using GitLab, verify that you have added at least a *Reporter* permission for the lecturer.

This assignment consist of multiple parts. You can write the parts into same script file right after another.

&nbsp;
### **Part 1**
Implement a Elixir script that:
- Ask a number from the user.
- If given number is evenly divisible by 3, print *Divisible by 3*.
- If given number is evenly divisible by 5, print *Divisible by 5*.
- If given number is evenly divisible by 7, print *Divisible by 7*.
- If given number is not evenly divisible by 3, 5 or 7, find smallest value (excluding 1) that number is evenly divisible for and print that value to the output.

### **Part 2**
Write an anonymous function that takes two parameters:
- Use a *guard* to check if both parameters are a string type. If so, return a combined string of the parameters.
- If parameters are not strings, return the addition result of the parameters.
- Test your anonymous function with string and number parameters and print the results.
