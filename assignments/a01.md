# Functional Programming

&nbsp;
## **Home Assignment 1**
Copy the source code to Moodle return box. Alternatively you can paste a link to GitLab. If using GitLab, verify that you have added at least a *Reporter* permission for the lecturer.

This assignment consist of multiple parts. You can write the parts into same script file right after another.

&nbsp;
### **Part 1**
1. Write an Elixir script that declares a variable and sets its value to 123.
2. Print the value of the variable to the console.
3. Add code that asks a text line from the user (*use* **IO.gets**).
4. Add text *<- You said that* to the text that user entered.
5. Print the combined text into the console.

&nbsp;
### **Part 2**
1. Write an Elixir script that calculates the result of *154 divided by 78* and prints it to the console.
2. Get the result of calculation (step 1) rounded to nearest integer and print it to console.
3. Get the result of calculation (step 1) and print only the integer part of it into the console.

&nbsp;
### **Part 3**
1. Ask a line of text from the user (*use* **IO.gets**).

3. Print the entered text in reverse.
4. Replace the word *foo* in entered text with *bar* and print resulted string into the console.

&nbsp;
### **Part 4**
1. Write an anonymous function that takes three parameters and calculates a product (multiplication) of those three values.
2. Ask three numbers from user (*use* **IO.gets** and **String.to_integer**) and pass them to your function created in step 1.
3. Print the result to the console.
4. Write an anonymous function that concats two lists and returns the result.
5. Call the list concat function and print the results.
