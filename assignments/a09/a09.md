Copy the source code to Moodle return box. Alternatively you can paste a link to GitLab. If using GitLab, verify that you have added at least a *Reporter* permission for the lecturer.

Use **gen_tcp** to implement message passing system with traditional *client-server networking model*.

- Implement server process that listens and accepts new connections.
- Implement client process that connects to the server and has interface to send a (text) message to the server.
- When server receives the message from client, it echoes the message to all other connected clients.
- Clients waits and shows messages from server.
- Manually test your implementation with at least two clients.

**Bonus:**
- Allow client to assign a name to itself after its connected to the server.
- When message is passed to other clients, show the name of the message originator.
